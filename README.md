# touchpad-toggle

This package contains a script to enable/disable a touchpad and the udev rules to do so automatically when an USB mouse is (dis)connected.

It is meant as an example how to automatically disable a touchpad when a mouse is plugged in, so feel free to be inspired and adapt to your own situation.

_Note_ The udev rules use a hardcoded user and user id, so before building and installing the package, please update
